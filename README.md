## About C
*The C programming language was developed by Dennis Ritchie at Bell Labs in the early ```1970s```. Dennis Ritchie, along with Ken Thompson, played a significant role in the creation of Unix operating system as well. C was initially developed as a successor to the B programming language, which was also developed at Bell Labs. C went on to become one of the most influential programming languages in the history of computing and has had a lasting impact on software development, system programming, and computer science.*
